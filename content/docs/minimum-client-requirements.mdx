# Minimum Client Requirements

<Callout type="info" title="Abstract">
  This page defines the minimum client-side features required to be considered
  officially compatible with NodeLink. It focuses only on endpoints, WebSocket
  flows, and payload extensions that a client must implement. Administrative and
  monitoring concerns are intentionally excluded.
</Callout>

## Introduction

NodeLink is compatible with the Lavalink v4 API, but it adds client-facing
features that go beyond the standard specification. A client that wants to be
considered an official NodeLink client must implement the minimum set below.
These items are not server-only toggles: they require client logic.

## Method

The list is derived from the NodeLink server implementation and limited to
differences that require explicit client support. Items that are operational,
administrative, or monitoring-oriented are excluded from the minimum.

## Results

### Minimum Feature Set

### Audio Mixer

**Minimum support**
- REST: `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /v4/sessions/:sessionId/players/:guildId/mix`
- WS events: `MixStartedEvent`, `MixEndedEvent`

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why it matters for clients">
    The mixer introduces new endpoints and event types. Clients must provide
    methods to create, manage, and remove layers, plus handle mix lifecycle
    events from the WebSocket.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Lyrics

**Minimum support**
- REST: `GET /v4/loadlyrics`

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why it matters for clients">
    Lyrics are retrieved through a NodeLink-specific endpoint. Clients must
    implement this call and handle the response format.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Chapters

**Minimum support**
- REST: `GET /v4/loadchapters`

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why it matters for clients">
    Chapters require a NodeLink-specific endpoint. Clients must implement the
    request and expose the chapter data to users.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Extra Filters

**Minimum support**
- Filters: `echo`, `chorus`, `compressor`, `highpass`, `phaser`, `spatial`

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why it matters for clients">
    These filters extend the Lavalink filter schema. Clients must allow these
    filter objects in the update payload and avoid rejecting unknown keys.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Voice Receive

**Minimum support**
- WS: `/v4/websocket/voice/:guildId`

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why it matters for clients">
    Voice Receive uses a second WebSocket stream. Clients must handle the
    binary frame format and reconnect logic for this channel.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Update Player Extras

**Minimum support**
- `voice.channelId` in Update Player payloads

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why it matters for clients">
    NodeLink extends the Update Player schema. Clients must pass and preserve
    `voice.channelId` for DAVE stability during voice connections.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### Search Prefixes

**Minimum support**
- Additional prefixes: `admsearch`, `amsearch`, `audiomack`, `bcsearch`,
  `bilibili`, `dzsearch`, `flowery`, `ftts`, `gaanasearch`, `gtts`, `jssearch`,
  `lfsearch`, `mcsearch`, `ncsearch`, `nicovideo`, `pdsearch`, `shsearch`,
  `speak`, `spsearch`, `szsearch`, `tdsearch`, `vksearch`

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why it matters for clients">
    These prefixes are resolved by NodeLink sources. Clients must allow them
    as valid search identifiers and not block them as invalid inputs.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

---

## Optional (Not Required for Official Compatibility)

These features are available in NodeLink but are not part of the minimum
compatibility bar for clients:

- `/v4/connection` (connection metrics endpoint used for diagnostics)
- `/v4/encodedtracks` (batch track encoding helper)
- `search:` unified search prefix for `/v4/loadtracks`
- `:playlist:` type modifier in search prefixes (example: `scsearch:playlist:lofi`)
- `track.audioTrackId` in Update Player payloads (optional; defaults to original
  audio unless the client selects an alternate YouTube auto-dubbed track)

---

## Conclusion

If a client implements the seven minimum areas above, it can be marked as an
official NodeLink-compatible client in the README feature matrix.
